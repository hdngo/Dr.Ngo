## Installation
Included is a JSON data file (program.json), feel free to change the data as long as it follows the same format and remains in the same location with the same name.

First install the dependencies by running:
`npm install`

Afterwards, start the app by running:
`npm start`

That's all there is to it!

## Tech
I chose to use React w/ Redux because part of the requirements was to have the app live entirely in the browser.
Aside from that, your typical webpack, SCSS, immutability-helper (God bless), etc.

## Todos
Definitely refactor for the sake of refactoring
Don't be lazy and add lazy loading
Add tests because fail
Add transitions and animations for that 'wowz, omg' factor

## Struggle Bus
This was definitely a challenge for me because I've only worked on React for < a month now, and when it came to state management I had a feeling I'd have to use Redux. Originally I had the intention of going crazy with some animations x transitions with the hope of learning GSAP and Pixi.js, but it definitely took time for me to grasp Redux and building a larger app in React while working on this. #manylessonslearned
